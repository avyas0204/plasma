This enumeration specifies the set of key types possible for any UML Property tagged with the SDOKey stereotype. Tags a property as a key used as an external identifier for a Class. An external identifier may be used by external systems and processes to uniquely idendify an object within the source system without significant central coordination. An external key is typically a universally unique identifier (UUID), globally unique identifier (GUID) or variant Tags a property as a key used as an internal identifier for a Class  A key used as a primary identifier for the UML Class of the UML Property tagged with the SDOKey stereotype. Specifies the nature of the data with respect to concurrency for a UML PropertyIndicates the data is an integral version number, typically incremented for every successful update of the owning entity.Indicates the data represents a system username, typically reset to the current system user on successful update of the owning entity.Indicates the data is temporal in nature typically reset to the system data or time for every successful update of the owning entity.Indicates the category of concurrency or concurrency control strategy under which a UML Property participates. Indicates a UML Property stores information related optimistic concurrency for its containing UML Class and participates in optimistic concurrency control operations and strategies. Informs SDO Data Access Services performing optimistic concurrency control checks and operations.Indicates a UML Property stores information related to a  pessimistic concurrency control strategy (often termed locking) and participates in pessimistic concurrency control operations. Informs SDO Data Access Services performing pessimistic concurrency control checks and operations.
Indicates a UML Property stores origination information for its containing UML Class. Informs Data Access Services (DAS) performing concurrent operations involving origination.Defines whether the specified element is restricted to only using the identified coding system for the elementIf not null, the element must be coded and must be drawn from the value set specified in the bindingIf not null, the element must be coded if there is an appropriate value in the value set specified in the binding.  If no appropriate code is available, a local code may be used, or the value may be populated with only original text.Specifies the various notions of time which are relevant for temporal data storesTransaction time is the time period during which a fact is stored in the databaseValid start time denotes the beginning of a time period during which a fact is true with respect to the real worldValid end time denotes the ending of a time period during which a fact is true with respect to the real worldQualifies an XML nodeAn XML elementAn XML attributeSpecifies the set of arrangements or organizations for any UML Property tagged with the SDOKey stereotype. no specified structural organization an integral identifier unique within a single column of an extenta universally unique identifier as specified in ISO/IEC 11578a specific compression algorithm from among those either written natively in Java or with a JNI integration availableThe Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer (LZO) algorithm, a lossless data compression algorithm that is focused on decompression speedoffers compression and decompression routines using the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithmlossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system.
