style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:TH'>The PlasmaQuery™ API provides
a flexible mechanism to fully describe any arbitrary SDO results Data Graph, independent
of any persistence framework or type of data store. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>PlasmaQuery™ supports XPath expressions as a free-text
“surface language”, parsed by the API implementation and used to construct an
underlying query object model representation. As an alternative to free-text,
PlasmaQuery™ contains a query Domain Specific Language (DSL) generator and API
facilitating (IDE) code-completion, 100% compile-time checking and resulting in
code with an almost “fluent” English appearance based on your business model. At
runtime the PlasmaQuery™ DSL implementation constructs an underlying query
object model representation. The detailed query object model can also be
manipulated directly and consists of various criteria entities such as
expressions, properties, operators, parameters, etc… as well as convenient
factory operations which allow precise user and system control over the various
elements constituting a query. The object model can also be serialized as XML
for wire transport, persistence, flat file or other usage. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
