Particular design consideration has been focused towards leaving each stereotype granular with only a few tightly related attributes/tags. This approach lets each stereotype convey far more meaning, but can have the effect of making UML diagrams more cluttered depending on the presentation settings of the UML diagramming tool. </p> <p> </p> <p> A single UML logical model enriched or annotated with this UML profile provides enough context specific information to support various technology-specific runtime environments and the generation of numerous context or platform-specific models as well as many other related source-code and other artifacts. The Service Data Objects 2.1 specification provides an extensible, lightweight runtime-available metadata API. It is through the SDO metadata API that the PlasmaSDO&#8482; implementation provides more than just standard structural metadata elements, but for models annotated with this UML profile, provides numerous other context specific metadata elements instructive at build-time as well as run-time to various enterprise technology layers and various parts of the platform technology stack. </p> </body> </html></body></html>
